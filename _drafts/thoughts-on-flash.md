## Thoughts on Flash

I'm still a bit frustrated with how Flash was killed off.  My experience here is surely one of many where history has effectively been wiped away.  I guarantee most people reading this article, will not go through the steps above to play this game and I don't blame them.  I see some progress being made with something like [ruffle.rs](https://ruffle.rs/#), a Rust flash emulator.  But at the time of writing this only supports less than 10% of ActionScript 3.  

I hear and understand the security argument for why Flash was abandoned, but I don't know if the punishment fits the crime.  When browsing the Internet, I could download any number of files that are malicious.  Websites are given free reign to track all my mouse movements, clicks, and browsing habits, but I am unable to acknowledge the risk of running the flash player on a file that I know is safe?  Browsers are (very slowly) finally getting around to adding all the functionality that Flash already had.  Surely, if they can safely sandbox things so could have Flash.

Steve Jobs berated Flash in his famous [Thoughts on Flash](https://newslang.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Thoughts-on-Flash.pdf) open letter.  Reading this now, it's hard not to replace most Adobe references with Apple, and Flash with Swift.  

> "Flash is a cross platform development tool. It is not Adobeâ€™s goal to help developers write the best iPhone, iPod and iPad apps. It is their goal to help developers write cross platform apps"

Jobs touts this as the primary reason that Flash wasn't allowed on iOS.
