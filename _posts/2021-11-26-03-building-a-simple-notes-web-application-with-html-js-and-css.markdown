This project is the main component of the [WEB 100 Course](/course/web/100). This post will describe the final project we will be creating and individual assignments will be created to incrementally work towards the final product.

As this is the first project in an introductory course, the final product will be very minimal. We will spend quite a bit of time going over foundational concepts as we run in to them. As much as possible, each assignment will leave you with a functional application that will continue to be built upon.
