When I was a Residence Advisor back at UBC, I received all kinds of coaching and advice about how to be a better leader. One piece of information has stuck with me ever since and it is the idea that for every negative interaction you have with someone, you need to have 5 positive ones to offset the negative one. 

As a residence advisor, it was easy to find yourself in the middle of a negative interaction.  Often they were minor, "hey, don't smoke so close to the building" or "you're being too loud, please be quiet".  Occasionally they were major, requiring a proper "Incident Report" to be written up.  Regardless of the scale it was immediately noticeable that after the negative interaction, tension between you and the other person involved grew.

When this tension increases a couple or a few times, it's ok.  But eventually, you find yourself in the territory of no return. This person instantly assumes you're only going to say something negative to them and in return they treat you in an unfriendly manner. Which then subconsciously irritates you more causing you to look for something else they're doing wrong.

Whether you're living on residence for a full school year or working in an office environment, conflict of some form is inevitable. You will still see or work with this person for a year or more. 

As a leader, you are often the one delivering difficult news or feedback. That's challenging in itself, but that's only the beginning. It is incredibly important to follow up on that interaction in the coming days and weeks with positive ones to re-establish equilibrium of the relationship.  This will help form trust on both sides and once the other person remembers that your sole purpose isn't just to be critical of them they will become more receptive to the feedback you have given them.
