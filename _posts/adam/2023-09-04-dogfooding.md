## Title Ideas:
From Dogfood to Paid Musician

## Introduction

This post as much a reminder to myself as it is a public service announcement for anyone building products.

Dogfooding means actively using the products or services you are developing.  If you are building a product and not using it almost every day, you are missing out on one of the best ways to improve the quality of the product. If you are a startup founder, I would almost go as far as saying that if you aren't using your product every day, you are signing up for failure.

I have tried to embody this philosophy for every project I have worked on so far.  Not only does it make it easier to understand what needs to be improved, but it makes the whole process more interesting and engaging.

## Kaizen

My latest project [kaizen.place](https://kaizen.place/) was probably one of the most difficult ones to start.  For context, Kaizen is a platform for music creators to share their work while it's still in progress.  

Several years ago I was in a choir, but I was never particularly keen to perform individually.  I had also played piano and violin for some time, though I never made it too far in either.

Since then I've uploaded 126 different iterations
