## [Randy](/authors/randy)

Randy ramped up his [Analog Sampling series](/tags/analog-sampling) this month with 4 new posts at a level of consistency I don't know if I'll ever reach.  

## [Adam](/authors/adam)

My posting has slowed to a crawl as I have been using my spare time to explore developing cross-platform games and applications in C using the SDL library. I'm nearing the end of my experimentation phase and will discuss some of my findings in upcoming posts. 

I've started a new ["management"](/tags/management) category that I'm hoping to build out. This will likely cover leadership related topics, but often specifically in the context of software management.

With Summer coming to a close, I suspect my frequency of writing will increase as we enter the colder and wetter months.
