**DIRT ON THE FRAME**

I would personally like to thank the motion picture industry for paying me over the years to help clean up in the movie business. Also, thanks to its new technology for polluting the planet to a slower and lesser degree now than before. Chief among the benefits of the sharp and painful transition from film to digital was the massive reduction in physical product manufacturing, distribution and disposal. 

One of the few projects I remember from grade school was my Grade 4 required report on pollution. Relying solely on magazine-type sources for pictures to cut out and glue paste, I found enough photographs of smoke spewing stacks, poisoned rivers and ruined landscapes to make the grade. The research and images burned my eyes; turned my stomach; learned my mind. I couldn't believe mankind could do such a thing to the same planet we eat and breathe from. I swore that I would never in my life be a polluter. 

**POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICE** 

Nevertheless, my first big job was at a pollution chugging chemical plant – with tailing ponds of acidic waste as large as a small city. My resistance to harming the earth melted away as fast as I could stash away that big paycheck, even after daily corrosive dust coatings and breathing deadly chemicals through gaps in my gas mask seal. 

In time my activist-style "memo to the management" essays earned me a reputation as a writer who could reasonably put words together for the big picture. I was assigned to create a training program for a key transportation function of the plant. Working with Wang word processors (ha!) and video equipment conveniently needed to be performed in an office, insulated from the noise, fumes and dust and shift work. 

After the summer project I was completed, I was unceremoniously dumped back out into the pollution and night shifts. It wasn't too long before I quit for a cleaner living; large paycheck and rational plans be damned. I figured computers weren't going to kill me, so they may have a future beyond typing. I better learn to type. 

**MOUNT FILLMORE** 

Flash forward in my timeline. I later worked for a Deluxe style company that once processed and distributed a billion feet of acetate-based film (used for movie release prints) per year, in order to get Hollywood films out to theaters around the world. That was billion. With a B. Per year – gradually getting to that high volume point over 90 years since the film business began. 

There was a competing company with a Technicolor name that produced a similar volume over the same long time frame, so let's just say – two heckuva lots of film feet pumped out of Los Angeles. 

Film started off on the wrong feet - the original type of film product was self-destructing and highly toxic to boot. Cellulose-nitrate film was used until about 1952, when it finally became apparent that basing your business model on a highly flammable product derived from military-grade explosives may not be so good an idea. 

Many a studio film storage facility burned to the ground if the film stock didn't disintegrate into powder first. New technology in film manufacture enabled the film industry to shine into the future, rather than fade into the past. Well, 60 more years into the future. 

**THE SHOW MUST GO ON** 

A SKU count of 7,000 copies of the master print was required for the average movie by the turn of the 21st century. Each print moved from city to town to village to overseas on pavement and diesel or air and jet fuel.  Multiply that by the hundreds of movies produced for theatrical release each year, and that adds up to many tons of product. Product that needs massive resources to go places on a strict timeline; by truck, by plane, by hook or crook. The movie plays on release date or there is hell to freeze over. 

With sales growing to a billion of anything by any measure, massive revenue ensues. With revenues come jobs, development, tax sources, and good stories – but also causing permanent blindness in one eye (just the one looking at potential problems). Still, with my good eye I saw no smokestacks obscuring the sun, and none of that film got me dirty or made me keel over from burned lungs. I am ahead of the game and plan at this point.  

**THE SHOW MUST GO... IN THE DUMP** 

When the rolling film reels fail to draw in enough paying customers, the product is declared dead. Spent reels may have worked just fine for another 100 years (just shine a light), but they were good for nothing when the next film came to town. Those billions of feet of film? Where does all that non-biodegradable hazard go to rot slower than a McDonald's Big Mac? 

Straight to the garbage dump, as there is no recycle code number for acetate film. Better than single use straws, or not. 

**TRADING ANALOG DOLLARS FOR DIGITAL DIMES** 

My company long had foresight that digital was a real thing, and that the writing was on the projection screen for the physical film distribution business. While enormous costs were invested to seed new replacement media technologies, the inevitable and more sudden than expected decline in revenues was jarring. The old school sales team used to joke that we were "trading analog dollars for digital dimes." It wasn't a joke - the days of chemically printing dollars was over. 

**COMPACT DISCONTINUED** 

Millions of containers with billions of feet of film in bits is still sitting out there in paid, climate controlled buildings. The magical era of digital movie-making serially  ushered in different physical products to hold the movie for processing and posterity: videotapes, data backup tapes, hard and solid state drives and memory devices. We have made a continent of new mountains with new movie media. At least it is not flammable. 

You can't shine a light through to see the content with any one of these newfangled technology items, and you will always need a specific machine and electricity to function. Unless made of a totally dead format, it is less necessary to throw away every piece of storage media, with reuse and recycling often being an option. 

Data will be stored until costs overcome value or product failure determines its fate. Note that every spinning hard drive ever created will stop working one day. Who knows when that will be, other than when needed most? 

**MYSTERY IN THE MAKING** 

Like switching from gasoline to electric cars, with Digital Everything we have just shifted the pollution up and down stream to where we really don't have to think about it. The movie meat comes nicely packaged down the cloud pipe so you have no need to think of the dead bits left at the factory, nor at the dump when done. 

Giant server farms and data centers are water wasters and coal eaters; heat generators; climate changers - and we will ruin a lot more Earth before we figure out something better using less energy. 

Direction from here is unknown, but feature film movies will always be trashed to a matter of degree - by critics, by necessity, or by design.
