I am Old School human; equipped with analog gears but upgraded with digital belts. Having a fair amount of past, I spend a lot of time reflecting on the past. It seems like I always have a need to measure and gauge my present with the paths and events it took to get me here. 

I have a million memories of positive greatness, but the reflections that come back are often on the negative side. Perhaps that is just physics. A mirror, says the Blue Oyster Cult, is a negative space in a frame. We see everything backwards (and upside down, you know). The positive in life was expected; the negative was not. 

The past is a reflection of us - important to revisit but more important not to live there. Every day we face a new barrage of problems and choices – who has time to look at old ones? 

In this series of articles – **Analog Sampling**, we shall mine and mind the media of the past to present a picture of the future - in small measured samples. To be definitively reflective, we will think quietly and calmly before expressing thoughts and opinions resulting from reflection; and aim to throw back light or sound on bygone eras with words and images. 

To start, **Sampling** is the process of converting continuous **Analog** signal data to **Digital** values; signals (waves) in the world are real world are analog. A **Sample** is a single measurement of **Amplitude** in **Time**. 

Key variables for determining the results and validity of sampling are: 

- **Sensitivity** - smallest change in an input signal that can cause the measuring device to respond 

- **Accuracy** - measure of the capability of the instrument to faithfully indicate the value of the measured signal 

- **Precision** - measure of the stability of the instrument and its capability of resulting in the same measurement over and over again for the same input signal 

- **Noise** - uncertainty of the measurement because of the effect of noise in the measurement and is factored into determining the accuracy 

The different spellings of the key word Analog (US) and Analogue (UK) could loosely be used as an example of analog vs. digital representation. The original word spelling Analogue is all/whole: analog; upon digital conversion, the unneeded data (u & e) is silent and not encoded. On playback, the audible result is the same – with Digital Analog coming in with a 25% letter saving. 

Starting from ground zero; my technology perspective comes from growing up in the 1960s, especially memories of visiting my grandparents on the farm. My mother's father was an early century homesteader – by the Roaring Twenties he had not a little house prairie and all the best of everything. 

Then 1929 crashed a lot of dreams; it seemed the family house and occupants got stuck in that time.  

The same big wooden box telephone and party line was still in use into the 60s. Their communication technology did not change for over 40 years. No one needed anything more than what they knew about at the time. 

We now live in a world where technology does not stay relevant for 40 years. While CDs are still going since 1983 and DVDs since 1997, it's only because we can't save ourselves from dipping into the Dollar Store Disc Bin. Being in any Digital business means that anyone can replicate your data, your product, your idea - at less cost to steal than it took you to make it. If you don't make it big fast, you are the one in the Dollar bin. In many industries, constant product churn is necessary just to keep even of the game. 

My present perspective is that I need to spend a lot more of my present tense time envisioning what my influence on the world's direction could be, so I can work more effectively now to radiate positive energy in the right direction. 

Amid plenty of success, significant portions of my used-up lifetime and hard-earned money were wasted chasing down a few wrong avenues and dreams. Bleeding edge learning came with a costly curve - the urge has long hoped to bury those bodies and cover the trail leading to them. My family has instead encouraged me to go back inside my head and make sense of those experiences - good and bad, as they relate to our family business today. 

Analog Sampling (or should it be Analog Dumpling: a bite sized pinch-wrapped morsel?) will thus forward be a digital (online) snippet of some analog (offline) part of the world as it happened to me. You probably don't need to hear the TLDR versions, so for the time sensitive audience we'll set the Frequency at weekly and the Amplitude at the 1,024-word stun level. 

While we can report on what is reflected behind us clearly (hindsight), we also hope to point the light cone ahead, from whence it comes and goes. The future can tell us exactly how things happened in the meantime – we just need the right projector to capture where the light dispersed from today is going and play it back. 

While sometimes we have a good concept of where we and the lighted path are going, we may just have to make some of this stuff up for now. The quantum future will reveal whether we are right or wrong, or both at the same time - the information will be there for further compare. 

We will attempt to flip the picture frame to positive and reverse: light to be thrown back the right way so that we may see improvements applicable for today. We may get into self-serving rants about tastes and wastes relating to planets, corporations, energy, habits, humans and resources, but all in the cause of providing a reasonably accurate sample with a precision theme, and with limited noise. 

How is that for X Sample?
