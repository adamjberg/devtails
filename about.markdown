## Hello, my name is Adam

After over 10 years of programming, I'm still disappointed in the state of programming content across the web and the pace that new developers are able to level up. I firmly believe that everyone in the world should learn to code. I have a lot of opinions, but until now, those have mostly only been shared with the teams I directly work with. 

This blog is where I will share my thoughts on software development topics such as #react, #javascript, #typescript, #engineeringmanagement, #rust, #webdevelopment, and #gamedevelopment.

## Why DevTails

Recently I started journaling about some work related events and also started to generally see more development stories being shared on the Internet. I thought it would be fun to have a place to share these "dev tales" (as I started to refer to them).  That seemed a bit too straightforward and one day I randomly stumbled on a photo of Tails from Sonic the Hedgehod and the moniker [devtails](https://twitter.com/devtails) was born.

When I was a kid [Sonic the Hedgehog 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2) was the greatest game I had ever played. As the younger sibling, I was destined to be player two (aka [Tails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tails_(Sonic_the_Hedgehog))). In two player mode, the game still really only cares about Sonic. The camera follows Sonic and sometimes I would find myself completely offscreen only to be teleported back to where Sonic actually was.  Some might not have considered this position fun. However, it came with a significant benefit: Tails could infinitely respawn. Lessons learned: only one person can be player one at a time and lean in to the strengths of whatever hand you've been dealt.

It is very difficult to find content of the appropriate depth when casually searching the web. Where applicable, I will categorize my posts by the apprenticeship terms. 

These roughly correlate to the usual job titles of junior, intermediate, senior, staff, and senior staff.  I find the term "senior" oversells how much experience someone actually has.  -->
