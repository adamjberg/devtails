| (Currently pre-alpha) Project based curriculum for learning

This page serves as a hub for the different kinds of programming courses offered.  The first course will focus on Full Stack Web Development.  In the future, there will be separate tracks for game development and embedded software.

Each course will be independent of the others, so you can jump in on the one that sounds interesting to you.

Before jumping in, have a look at [how to start learning to code](/learn/how-to-start-learning-to-code).  After that, get ready to being by learning [how to set up your development environment](/learn/how-to-setup-your-development-environment).
